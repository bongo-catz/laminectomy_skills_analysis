In this folder is data for Juan and Hisashi's 2022 SDF Userstudy submitted to IPCAI and IROS

- The names of the individual recording files have been appended to include the anatomy used, guidance
modality, and an identifier.
- A dictionary of volumes including letter name, corresponding segmented volume name, and volume picture
is also in this folder
- Fields including trial number, guidance modality, and volume have been added to redcap such that the
simulator recordings can be associated with the TLX data, and participant demographics. As a note, the way
trials were associated with simulator data were using timestamps, and recording order from various data
analysis files from the studies. 
- An exported, deidentified redcap file is in the folder for your convenience.
